I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.sustech.edu.cn/) at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) in Shenzhen, China, and I am expected to graduate in June 2025. 
My advisors are  Academician  Fuquan Fang and Assistant Professor [Yifei Zhu](https://yifeizhu.github.io). 
my doctoral research focuses on â€‹Topological Data Analysis and its Theoretical Foundations.

I obtained my master's degree from [Nankai University](https://math.nankai.edu.cn/) in Tianjin, China in June 2020. 
My research topic during my master's studies was rational homotopy theory.
